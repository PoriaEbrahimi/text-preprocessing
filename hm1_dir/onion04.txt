Kindergarten Class Burning Through 6 Hamsters A Year.
Nov 21, 2013. Attributing the high levels of attrition to a combination of handling errors and poor oversight, Holy Trinity School kindergarten teacher Alyssa Orazio told reporters today that her class is currently burning through hamsters at a rate of six per year, with every indication that the figure will rise. We blew through two in one week this October, said Orazio, adding that if her students continue to cycle through the rodents at this pace, current classroom pet Lancelot likely will not live to see Thanksgiving break. Take-homes are now a hard, hard no. But I figure if we reduce out-of-cage playtime and take Rory and Eva off feeding privileges entirely, we might be able to get the average down to a more reasonable number. Orazio added that if Benjamin Szygenda were to be transferred to a different class, it would likely have an enormously positive effect on their average hamster's lifespan.
